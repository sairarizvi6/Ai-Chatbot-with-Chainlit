🚀*** I Just Built My First AI Chatbot using Google Gemini & Chainlit***!

Introducing hello_agent – a beginner-friendly yet powerful chatbot built using Python, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Chainlit.

🔧 Tech Highlights:

📌 Environment Setup

Using dotenv, the Gemini API key is loaded securely from environment variables.

📌 Model Integration

The chatbot uses AsyncOpenAI with Gemini 2.0 Flash through a custom base URL (https://lnkd.in/dXXGaj8d).

 It’s wrapped with OpenAIChatCompletionsModel to handle conversation logic.📌 Agent Definition
 
An AI agent is created using the Agent class with clear instructions:

“A helpful assistant that can answer questions and provide information.”

📌 Async Chat Interface

Using Chainlit, the interface listens for @cl.on_chat_start and @cl.on_message, making the interaction smooth and real-time.

🌱 What I Learned:

How to integrate Generative AI APIs

Managing API keys securely

Using async functions in Python

Building real-time chat interfaces with Chainlit

👉I'm truly excited to keep learning and exploring the world of AI!🌟,
